    <p>
      Verifying that a file you downloaded or received is actually the one you were
      expecting is often overlooked or too time-consuming to do. At the same time, it
      has become very easy to get your hands on a file that has been tampered with, due
      to the mass increase of malicious webpages and other actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tool aims to solve that. Hashbrown comes with a simple &amp; clean UI, allowing
      anyone, from any age and experience group, to generate, compare and verify MD5,
      SHA-256 and SHA-1 hashes.
